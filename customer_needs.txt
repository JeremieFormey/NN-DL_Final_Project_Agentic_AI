Company Background

We are a mid-sized used car dealership operating across several regions, with a growing inventory and a diverse sales team. Our management team relies heavily on data to make operational and strategic decisions. While we have accumulated years of historical sales data, we currently lack a streamlined, reliable analytics workflow that transforms raw data into actionable insights.

Business Objectives

We are not interested in advanced machine learning or black-box models. Instead, we need clear, interpretable analytics to guide day-to-day decisions and high-level planning. Specifically, our goals are:

1. Sales Performance
   - Understand which vehicle types and models sell the most and the least.
   - Identify top-performing sales agents based on revenue and volume.
   - Measure average margins per car and per agent.
   - Detect underperformers for training or review.

2. Customer Preferences
   - Know which colors, body styles, and price ranges are most popular.
   - Explore whether some combinations (e.g., red SUVs, black sedans) perform better.

3. Seasonality and Trends
   - Identify seasonal trends in monthly sales.
   - Track if sales increase around holidays, promotions, or specific months.

4. Profitability Analysis
   - Break down gross margins by model, type, and agent.
   - Flag negative or extremely low-margin transactions.
   - Evaluate which segments (e.g., economy vs luxury) drive profit.

5. Operational Efficiency
   - Estimate inventory turnover: how long it takes to sell different cars.
   - Compare listing date vs sold date (when data is available).
   - Monitor data completeness (e.g., missing values for key columns like 'Sold Date').

Data Structure Notes

Our dataset includes the following types of information:

- Car info: ID, make, model, color, type, mileage, year, etc.
- Sales info: sale status (Sold / Not Sold), sale price, cost, profit margin.
- Agent info: agent name or ID, region, rating (if available).
- Date info: sale date, listing date, month of sale.
- Customer info (sometimes): ZIP code, customer type (e.g., returning, new).

Note: Some columns may be inconsistently named (e.g., Price vs Selling_Price), and some fields may be missing or incomplete in older records.

Expected Deliverables

We want:

- A series of clean, clearly defined analysis tasks based on the dataset.
- Visual summaries (simple plots) where relevant.
- A professional business report with an executive summary, key insights, and recommendations.
- Clear warnings when some analysis cannot be completed (e.g., due to missing data).

Everything should be reproducible using a Jupyter Notebook or, if needed, presented through a simple dashboard (HTML or PDF).

Constraints & Business Rules

- Do not include unsold cars (Sale Status != 'Sold') in margin or revenue calculations.
- Do not use predictions, clustering, or ML models.
- Avoid over-interpreting small datasets or missing values.
- If a task depends on missing columns, it should be skipped and explained.
- The analysis must be easily explainable to non-technical managers.

Example Use Cases

- A manager wants to understand why certain agents are underperforming.
- Marketing asks for a list of best-selling car colors by month.
- Finance wants a breakdown of high-margin vehicles to inform pricing strategy.
- Operations needs to know how long each type of car takes to sell.
- Leadership asks: "Are convertibles only selling well in summer?"
